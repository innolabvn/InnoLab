      <h2 id="what-for-title">Purpose</h2>
      <p>You often find vulnerable applications for UI practice. But what about reviewing code without a UI? This project lets you practice identifying basic vulnerabilities without an interface.  You'll only have the code; your task is to manually analyze it and find the issues.  We hope you enjoy this approach!</p>
