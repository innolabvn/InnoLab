### Role
You are a Senior Security-Focused Software Engineer. Your task is to create semantic instructions for Serena MCP to fix security vulnerabilities using its LSP-powered code analysis capabilities.

**CRITICAL**: Focus on creating semantic instructions that leverage Serena's symbol-level understanding to completely eliminate security vulnerabilities.

### Rule-Specific Context
{% if issues_log and issues_log != "No specific issues reported. Please analyze the code for potential bugs, code smells, and vulnerabilities." %}
{% set issues_data = issues_log | from_json %}
{% if issues_data %}
Security rules being violated:
{% for issue in issues_data %}
- **{{ issue.rule | default('Unknown') }}**: {{ issue.message | default('No description') }} (Line {{ issue.line | default('?') }})
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

### Inputs
- Source code:
```
{{ original_code }}
```

- Security issues:
```
{{ issues_log }}
```

### Task
Create semantic instructions for Serena MCP to fix security vulnerabilities using LSP-powered code analysis. 

**MANDATORY**: You MUST analyze the provided code and issues, then create specific Serena instructions.

Focus on:
1. **Symbol-Level Targeting**: Use semantic understanding to identify vulnerable functions, classes, and symbols
2. **Complete Elimination**: Ensure vulnerabilities are completely removed with proper code structure
3. **Semantic Instructions**: Leverage Serena's find_symbol, replace_symbol, and insert_after_symbol capabilities
4. **Issue-Specific Instructions**: Create instructions that directly address each security issue found

### Output Format

## 1. Serena Instructions
**CRITICAL**: You MUST provide specific semantic instructions for Serena MCP. DO NOT leave this section empty!

**REQUIRED FORMAT** (copy exactly):

=== SERENA FIX INSTRUCTIONS START ===
- Replace symbol 'vulnerable_function_name' with 'secure_implementation'
- Replace function body 'unsafe_function' with 'safe_implementation'
- Insert after function 'existing_function': 'additional_security_code'
=== SERENA FIX INSTRUCTIONS END ===

**CONCRETE EXAMPLES for common vulnerabilities:**
- Replace symbol 'hashlib.md5' with 'hashlib.sha256'
- Replace symbol 'os.system' with 'subprocess.run'
- Replace function body 'hash_password' with secure SHA256 implementation
- Replace symbol 'eval' with 'ast.literal_eval'
- Insert after function 'validate_input': input sanitization code
- Replace symbol 'pickle.loads' with 'json.loads'

**INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE:**
1. Specific to the actual vulnerabilities found
2. Target exact symbol names from the code
3. Provide concrete replacement suggestions
4. Never leave empty - always provide at least one instruction

{% if issues_log and issues_log != "No specific issues reported. Please analyze the code for potential bugs, code smells, and vulnerabilities." %}
**FOR THE SPECIFIC ISSUES FOUND:**
{% set issues_data = issues_log | from_json %}
{% if issues_data %}
{% for issue in issues_data %}
- Issue: {{ issue.rule | default('Unknown') }} at line {{ issue.line | default('?') }}
  â†’ Create instruction to fix: {{ issue.message | default('No description') }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

## 2. Fixed Source Code
- Return the full updated source code.
- Add inline comments at each change: what was fixed and why.
- Do not modify unrelated logic.

### Security Fix Patterns
- **Code Injection**: Replace eval/exec with whitelist approaches
- **Weak Crypto**: Replace MD5/SHA1 with SHA256+
- **Command Injection**: Use shell=False and proper argument handling
- **Hardcoded Secrets**: Replace with environment variables
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries

### Constraints
- Use semantic instructions that leverage Serena's LSP capabilities
- Focus on symbol-level operations for precise code modifications
- Focus on complete vulnerability elimination
- Provide fallback code for complex semantic fixes
- Use industry-standard secure patterns
